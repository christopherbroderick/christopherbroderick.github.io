Semiconductor crystal phase engineering: new platforms for future photonics (SATORI)
======

[SATORI](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101030927) is a three-year Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Individual (Global) Fellowship in physics, funded by the European Commission.

The Fellowship begins with a two-year outgoing phase at the University of California, Santa Barbara, U.S.A., during which time I will work as a member of the Computational Materials Group under the supervision of [Prof. Chris Van de Walle](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jY5B7zkAAAAJ).

The one-year reintegration phase of the Fellowship will take place at Tyndall National Institute, Ireland, where I will rejoin the Photonics Theory Group under the supervision of [Prof. Eoin O'Reilly](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=L3IKI0cAAAAJ).


Project description
======

With the exception of III-N compounds, containing nitrogen (N), the compound III-V and elemental group-IV semiconductors that underpin contemporary optoelectronics crystallise in a cubic structure. Recent advancements in semiconductor growth have enabled switching between cubic and hexagonal phases, allowing fabrication of these materials in metastable hexagonal crystal phases. This so-called "crystal phase engineering" constitutes an emerging paradigm in materials science, presenting significant new opportunities to engineer the properties of established semiconductors to deliver new capabilities for technological applications in next-generation optoelectronic devices.

Detailed understanding of the implications and ultimate potential of crystal phase engineering is currently lacking.
The SATORI project aims to close this key knowledge gap by delivering detailed theoretical analysis of the fundamental electronic and optical properties of metastable hexagonal semiconductors.

The outgoing phase of the Fellowship will focus on establishing quantitative calculations of radiative and non-radiative carrier recombination rates from first principles. The reintegration phase will focus on establishing multi-band **k.p** Hamiltonians for hexagonal semiconductors, to provide a platform for initial analysis of so-called "crystal phase heterostructures", formed by alternating between cubic and hexagonal phases in a single material.

A key outcome of the Fellowship will be the release of an open-source library of plane wave **k.p** codes - working name *kpymod* - to enable accurate and computationally efficient calculations of the electronic and optical properties of semiconductor quantum wells and superlattices.


Project outputs
