I am a theoretical and computational condensed matter physicist, currently working in the [Van de Walle Computational Materials Group](https://vandewalle.materials.ucsb.edu/) at the University of California, Santa Barbara, as a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Individual Fellow.

I am on secondment from the [Photonics Theory Group](https://www.tyndall.ie/theory) at Tyndall National Institute, University College Cork, Ireland, where I am also a Research Fellow with the [Irish Photonic Integration Centre](https://www.ipic.ie/).
